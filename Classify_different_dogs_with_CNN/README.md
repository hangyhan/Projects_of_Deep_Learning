**In this project, the task is**

- If the object is a dog, tell the breed of that dog. 

**In the dog_classification.py, there are 2 different implementations for this task.**
-   A CNN trained only for this task.
-   A CNN made up of a pre-trained Resnet to extract bottleneck features and a simple classfication network to finish the task.

**Some final outputs are as below:**
